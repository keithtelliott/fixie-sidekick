# fixie-sidekick-template
Template project for building a Fixie Sidekick.

There are a number of places in the template marked "TODO". You should update the project in these places for your sidekick.

This template is ready to deploy and makes use of a document corpus that contains information about various types of foxes. You should create your own corpus and replace the example with the new corpus ID.

You also need to run ```npm install``` prior to deploying. Then you can deploy with ```npm run deploy```
